#An investigation into Euclid’s *Elements* using primary sources#
##Rebecca Finnigan##

----

#Why are diagrams important?#

* yield insights into a mathematician's work
* paint visual versions of what the text is saying
* give readers a fuller sense of the mathematics

----

#Manuscripts of Euclid's *Elements*#

1. D'Orville 301, Bodleian Library
2. Arabic 2484, National Library of France
3. Latin 10257, National Library of France

----

#Who was Euclid?#

* one of the most influential ancient Greek mathematician
* flourished in Alexandria around 300 BCE
* his *Elements* was used as a basic geometry textbook soon after its initial publication
* his works were one of the first, if not the first, to be translated from Greek into Arabic

----

#Arabic Transcriptions#

* writing system goes from right to left:  كتاب = ktab
* number system goes from left to right: ٢٠١٥ = 2015
* so then what direction should the diagrams and their labels be drawn in?

----

#Preliminary observations#


2. characteristics such as the placement of the diagrams within the text
3. how many diagrams appear per proposition
4. how the labels work within the diagram
5. any paleographic details such as handwriting and ink color

----

#Placement of diagrams#

* [D'Orville 301](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:episteme:dorv301img.euc050) and Codex Bodmer 8: one-to-one with diagrams appearing at end of proposition as a finale of sorts
* [Arabic 2484](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img296@0.0711,0.3413,0.3724,0.189): not all one-to-one with some propositions containing extra steps for the proofs





----

#Diagram construction#

* examples which show that the diagrams come secondary to the main text

----

##Codex Bodmer 8##

* contains [spaces](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:ecod:codbod8.cb-0008_035v) left for diagrams within the text after about 30 folios of diagrams

----

##Book 10 of the D'Orville 301##

* contains many propositions which incude the wrong diagram 
* especially evident from [proposition 10.91 to 10.110](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:episteme:dorv301img.euc264)
* shows the possiblility that the scribe was copying one diagram after another into the manuscript and lost count of which proposition he was drawing

----

##Arabic 2484##

* [propositions 1.1 through 1.45](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img306@0.1433,0.2817,0.3567,0.1139) are drawn in red ink with black labels
* [propositions 1.46 through 2.11](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img311@0.1924,0.4403,0.4248,0.202) are drawn in all black ink with a different hand
* [spaces](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img317) left for diagrams within the text after proposition 2.11

----

* propostions 1.3 and 1.4 share a space within the text for [proposition 1.3](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img297)

----

#Comparing diagrams across three languages#

* physical drawing of the diagrams 
* labels placed on the diagrams

----

##Labeling practices##

* symmetric diagrams such as in proposition 1.25: compare the [Greek](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:episteme:dorv301img.euc024@0.3383,0.6044,0.1401,0.1582) with the [Arabic](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img305@0.2685,0.7462,0.3357,0.0974)
* LATIN: NEED TO MAKE THE POINT ABOUT WHY THERE ARE NO LABELS!

----

* unsymmetric diagrams such as in proposition 1.22: compare the [Greek](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:episteme:dorv301img.euc022@0.6306,0.6187,0.2563,0.1551) with the [Arabic](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img304@0.0992,0.3605,0.4269,0.1441)

----

##General conclusions about labels##

* Greek labels travel from left to right
* Arabic labels travel from right to left
* number of labels usually the same with some exceptions such as the error in the Arabic [proposition 1.27](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img306@0.0421,0.5413,0.3918,0.0988)

----

##Drawing practices##

* mirroring of individual figures
* order of figures does not seem to matter
* more complex figures drawn mirrored, but also some such as proposition 2.6 appear to be drawn upside-down in the [Arabic](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img314@0.0931,0.1073,0.3463,0.1488) as compared to the [Greek](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/ict.html?urn=urn:cite:episteme:dorv301img.euc040@0.6416,0.5994,0.1842,0.1719)

----

#Looking to the Text#

* [labels used in the diagrams](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/mss/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:bnf:ar2484img.bnf_arabe_2484_img304) denoted by bars for the letters within the text
* Greek manuscript refers to both points and segments
* Arabic manuscript refers to only segments

----

#Conclusion#

* diagrams are drawn into the manuscript on at a least a second pass
* creation of diagrams can be seen as a scholarly act similar to the creation of the text

----

Thank you!
