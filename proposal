Diagrams are often overlooked when scholars examine manuscripts. However, they are just as important to mathematical documents as the words are. The diagrams yield further proof of the mathematician's work and can make it more understandable for the reader by painting a visual version of what the words are saying. Hundreds of years ago, diagrams were drawn in a different fashion than is seen today. For example, scribes used arcs where there should be line segments and vice versa. At some point, this system changed. Critical editions of the works of ancient mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes portray the diagrams as we would see them today rather than how they appear in the manuscripts. I think it is important to take a step back and examine the digrams as they originally were drawn while comparing them to what we find now.
